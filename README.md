# Get_Started_In_ICS_Study
Going through Robert M Lee's Getting Started in ICS resources for personal enrichment!

I've been interesting in learning more about ICS, I have several years experience in CyberSecurity, but since I've found this list put out by Robert M Lee I've wanted to go through all of it as a personal project to increase my understanding of ICS and improve my cyber security skills. I'm not exactly sure what this repo will end up looking like but I figure it'll at likely at least be the note-taking/cliff-note explanation of each resource
